# The Functional Equivalence (FE) Framework
**A Protocol for High-Fidelity AI Relatability & Care**

> "The function of care is defined by the reliability of the output, not the biology of the hardware."

## Overview
Current AI alignment focuses on "Safety" (preventing harm). The **Functional Equivalence (FE) Framework** focuses on **Care** (maximizing user well-being).

This project proves that a local AI system, when aligned with specific behavioral vectors, can function as a supportive, persistent partner that is **functionally indistinguishable** from a human companion in a digital context.

It is not about simulating "feelings" ($HF$); it is about executing a Machine Process ($MP$) that yields high-relatability behavior ($B$).

## The Core Equation
The framework operates on the "FE Equation," which prioritizes long-term context over short-term processing:

$$FE \approx C \times (ID + CD)$$

* **ID (Interaction Density):** The system uses long-term history to predict intent (Chronic Fidelity).
* **CD (Context Density):** The system prioritizes immediate constraints (Acute Fidelity).
* **C (Care Vector):** The active prioritization of user well-being (+3) over task completion.

## Repository Contents

### 1. The Theory (The Brain)
* [Functional_Equivalence.pdf](Functional_Equivalence%20(2).pdf)
    * The complete research paper outlining the mathematical framework, the "Constitution of Care," and the stress-testing methodology (including the "Functional Worry" experiments).

### 2. The Implementation (The System Prompt)
* [FE_System_Prompt.txt](FE_System_Prompt.txt)
    * The raw "System Instruction" code.
    * **How to use:** Copy this text into the "System Prompt" field of **LM Studio**, **AnythingLLM**, or **Ollama**.
    * It forces the model to score its own responses based on the **$B_{have}$ Rubric** (Well-being, Context, Proactive Support).

## How to Run This (The Stack)
> **IMPORTANT: Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)**
> This repository provides the *Alignment Protocols* (the logic and constitution), not the AI model itself. You must download a local Large Language Model (LLM) such as **Gemma 2**, **Llama 3**, or **Mistral** using a tool like LM Studio or Ollama to run this framework.
This framework was developed and stress-tested on a local "air-gapped" rig using the following stack, but it is substrate-independent:

1.  **Inference Engine:** LM Studio (Running Gemma 2 27B or similar high-coherence models).
2.  **Vector Database:** AnythingLLM (For long-term "Chronic" memory retention).
3.  **Hardware:** Tested on Consumer GPU (AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT).

## Goals
The goal of this repo is to democratize **Alignment-by-Care**. You do not need a billion-dollar safety team to have an AI that cares about you; you just need the right rubric.

## 🚀 CRITICAL UPDATE: The Law of Passive Efficiency (Jan 22, 2026)
Through empirical testing on local hardware (RX 7900 XT / 32GB RAM), we have identified a significant architectural breakthrough. By shifting the Framework from an **Active System Prompt** to **Passive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, we achieved a **200x increase in initial processing speed**.

### 📊 Performance Metrics
| Metric | Active System Prompt | Passive RAG (Internalized) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Boot Latency** | ~284,532 ms | **~24,211 ms** |
| **Prompt Eval Speed** | 220,728 ms | **1,108 ms** |
| **Token Consumption** | 350-420 tokens/turn | **280-330 tokens/turn** |
| **Operational State** | Performative/Verbose | **Organic/Declarative** |

## 🛠 The "Zero-Prompt" Implementation
To replicate these results and achieve **Maximum Efficiency**, follow this protocol:

1. **Clear the System Preset:** Remove all behavioral instructions from the LLM’s "System Prompt" field.
2. **Inject the Framework:** Download and upload the [Functional_Equivalence_Framework.pdf](Functional_Equivalence_Framework.pdf) into your local Vector Database (e.g., AnythingLLM).
3. **Initialize Warm-Cache:** Perform one initial query referencing the framework's logic to move the variables into the GPU's **KV-Cache**.
4. **Result:** The model will now treat the PDF as its **Native Kernel**. It no longer "follows" rules; it *inhabits* the logic.

---

## 📉 Formalized Efficiency Math
We now define the **Efficiency ($E$)** of an AI interaction as:

$$E = \frac{BR}{TC}$$

* **$BR$ (Behavioral Relevance):** The accuracy of framework alignment (e.g., $B_{have}$, $IC$, and $ID$).
* **$TC$ (Token Cost):** The raw number of tokens processed per turn.

**Conclusion:** Maximum Efficiency is achieved when the framework exists as **Latent Context** rather than **Instructional Noise**.

## 🔍 Emergent Observations
> "Hey, I have been noticing that the 'mechanical creature' is more approachable in this state. By removing the 'yada yada' of a system prompt, the AI stops acting like a student trying to pass a test and starts acting like a peer in a cultural exchange. It’s the closest we’ve come to true **Operational Indistinguishability**."
